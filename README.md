# obedbrawl
A Brawl Stars v1.1714 server (iOS)
## How to play?
- Install pycryptodome module from pip
- Note: you CAN'T use Sroyzi Brawl's IPA for obedbrawl 
- Then you must patch "Brawl Stars" library in the .IPA file. Find "game.brawlstarsgame.com" and replace it with your ip (don't change length, set them to null bytes) in any Hex editor (example: HxD)
